# Assignment-2
 
<h2>Description</h2>
For this assignment, I decided to create a landing page for a fake photography company which I named Luminous. 

<h2>Color Scheme</h2>
My webpage is in grayscale and mainly used these colors:
<ul>
 <li>#ffffff</li>
 <li>#393939</li>
 <li>#000000</li>
</ul>

When I had decided to create a landing page for a phototgraphy company, I had immediately thought of black and white images. They tend to have a timeless feel to it so I decided to not any bright colors in my webpage.


<h2>Media Queries and Responsive Navbar</h2>
Media queries and creating a responsive navbar was quite a challenge to me. I spent alot of time on the media queries styling the contents and learning how to hide the links once the screen is at a certain width. Once it reaches the width of 820px, he list icon will show and the links won't be displayed. The logo also changes.

<h2>Animation</h2>
As for animation, unfortunately, I didn't spend as much time. I was only able to add in some simple animations.
